<p style="color:black;">                        The roots of State Bank of India lie in the first decade of the 19th century when the Bank of Calcutta later renamed the Bank of Bengal, 
was established on 2 June 1806. 
The Bank of Bengal was one of three Presidency banks, the other two being the Bank of Bombay (incorporated on 15 April 1840) and the Bank of Madras (incorporated on 1 July 1843). 
All three Presidency banks were incorporated as joint stock companies and were the result of royal charters.
These three banks received the exclusive right to issue paper currency till 1861 when, with the Paper Currency Act, the right was taken over by the Government of India. 
The Presidency banks amalgamated on 27 January 1921, and the re-organised banking entity took as its name Imperial Bank of India. 
The Imperial Bank of India remained a joint-stock company but without Government participation.
